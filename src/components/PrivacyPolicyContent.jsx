            Rights about automated decision-making and profiling. You have the
            right to be free from decisions based solely on automated processing
            of your Personal Data, including profiling, which produces a
            significant legal effect on you, unless such profiling is necessary
            for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between you and
            us, or with your explicit consent. We use automated decision-making
            to ensure that we comply with various laws and regulations
            restricting what regions, individuals, and entities we can work
            with. We also use automated decision-making to ensure applications
            from Freelancers and Job Applicants meet our minimum requirements.
            You may contact us at privacy@geoespacec.ca to obtain an explanation
            of the decision or for a personal review, if possible.

            any time, but this will not affect any data that we already
            processed.
